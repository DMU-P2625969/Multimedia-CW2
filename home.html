  DISNEY PARKS ADD ‘INCLUSION KEY’ TO CAST MEMBER TRAINING
  At Disneyland Paris – and at Disney resorts around the world – we strive to create a culture of inclusion, where everyone is welcome. As part of this focus, we are always evolving and actively listening to our guests and cast members, creating an environment where all people feel valued, welcomed and appreciated.

  In 2019, we actively solicited input from our cast members from all over the world in a series of ideation sessions that generated more than 100 ideas, including the addition of Inclusion to The Four Keys.

  For more than 65 years, our cast members have welcomed guests from around the world with the help of The Four Keys – Safety, Courtesy, Show and Efficiency – which guide our renowned approach to service around the world. Each of these embody a core value that serves as a guiding principle for cast members in their daily work. The addition of the Inclusion Key emphasizes its ongoing importance in all that we do and will be a constant reminder to us that all who come to this happy place are welcome. Watch the video below for more details!


  This is just the beginning, as we continue to work toward a world where we all belong. There’s more to do, but we are excited for what’s next as we continue to listen, learn and work towards a more inclusive future for our cast and guests. You can read more about Inclusion Key on the Disney Parks Blog.

FRENCH CRAFTWORKERS BRING NEW LIFE TO SLEEPING BEAUTY CASTLE
Sleeping Beauty Castle is undergoing its first major refurbishment since 1992, making this iconic symbol of Disneyland Paris more sparkling than ever for guests to enjoy.

Disneyland Paris has a long-standing history of collaborating with French and European craftsmen to create all those beautifully detailed locations at our Parks. And To carry out this large-scale project with respect for the craftsmanship and level of detail that our resort is known for, Walt Disney Imagineering and Construction teams are calling on French specialists in the field of historical monument renovations. Nine companies – all French – have been mobilized to carry out the work, including carpentry, roofing, painting and metalworking. Disneyland Paris has a long-standing history of collaborating with French and European craftsmen to create all those beautifully detailed locations at our Parks

One such French company is Le Bras Frères, renowned for its incredible work on the greatest French monuments and now providing its unique know-how for the refurbishment on the framework and roof of our Castle. Have a look on the incredible work they are doing now!
