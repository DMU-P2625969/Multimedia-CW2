Sleeping Beauty Castle: A Fairytale Come True
Rising high in the sky at the end of Main Street, U.S.A®, Sleeping Beauty Castle welcomes you to a magical world of fantasy and fun. The central icon of Disneyland Paris, the Castle invites all who visit to celebrate in a place where dreams come true.
A Classic Design
A truly fairytale castle, boasting soaring spires, ornate turrets, regal royal-blue rooftops, stained glass windows and tapestries, the 167-foot structure invokes both the magic and mystery of fictional palaces like the one seen in Disney's animated classic Sleeping Beauty, as well as elements from real French castles and historic monuments.

Adding to the enchanted environment, the castle is surrounded by square trees and is home to a large sleeping dragon that occasionally awakens, puffs smoke and roars.</p>

<p>The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror: A Grand Re-Opening
Tour the infamous Hollywood Tower Hotel, the one-time haunt of Tinseltown's rich and famous until a mysterious incident forced it to close in 1939. At The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, venture under the iron-wrought iron gates of the abandoned abode and step inside a dusty lobby, seemingly frozen in time.

Edge into a dark library with strange artifacts. As lightning illuminates the darkened room, a nearby television set springs to life and Rod Serling welcomes you on a journey into the Twilight Zone.

From a secret passage, trudge into the shadowy confines of the dilapidated boiler room, home to rattling machinery and your vessel into the 5th dimension: the service elevator. Enter the rickety lift and strap yourself in, light bulbs spookily flickering on and off above you.

Going Up?
Seated in the elevator, launch upward in darkness until the corroded doors unlock to expose a lengthy hallway inhabited by the otherworldly hotel inhabitants from 1939. Beckoning for you to join them, the spooky spectres dematerialise and your skyward journey continues.

First Stop, the Looking Glass
As you ascend the 13 floors, your elevator shudders to a halt and the doors creakily part. You can clearly see your reflection in the ornate mirror that sits across the hallway. But then, following a flash of lightning and some ghostly goings on, your reflection eerily fades, leaving an elevator containing not one living soul. Have you been transported to another dimension?

Going down!
No matter which horror haunts your experience, one thing is certain – you’ll shriek in terror as the elevator freefalls down the abandoned shaft before unexpectedly changing direction and launching back up the hotel. Gaze out through a missing wall 13 storeys high as the doors inexplicably open and close to reveal the hotel grounds. Then, just as you catch your breath, the lift plummets down and speeds upward over and over again, the sound of cables snapping and metal clanging overhead. Will you make it back to the real world... or will you become a permanent resident of The Twilight Zone?</p>
